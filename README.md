# Apocalypse Writeup

## Description

There is an AI robots apocalypse in the city. The steps to stop the apocalypse and how to survive after the apocalypse are hidden in the computer that is in the physics lab of Concordia University.

## Solution

(1) `[physicslab.webp]` picture is first given to participants. There is nothing hidden in the page. Then, you check the http link. You found `/page1` at the end of the http link, so you wonder what `/page2` is like. So you look for `/page2`.

(2) In `/page2`, you will see professor Weasley asking you to eat somthing to prove that you are a human and not a robot. There is a hint in the picture -> the prof is giving you a cookie. So, you manipulate the web cookie with key `is_human` by setting its value to `true`

(3) In `/human`, you will see the password in a comment if you inspect the page. `body > div > form > input[type="password"]:nth-child(2)`

(4) In `/files`, the flag is hidden in the setting of EMP file.

(5) In `/emp`, the answer for the next sequence is 1081 and it is the code to set off EMP. Here is the link for how to solve the next sequence https://alteredqualia.com/visualization/hn/sequence/ and you get the flag.
